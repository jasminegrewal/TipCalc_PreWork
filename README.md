The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Project Analysis

**Question 1**: "What are your reactions to the iOS app development platform so far? How would you describe outlets and actions to another developer? Bonus: any idea how they are being implemented under the hood? (It might give you some ideas if you right-click on the Storyboard and click Open As->Source Code")

**Answer:** I really like the iOS app development so far. It's neat and easy to start working on it. I am looking forward to this class more than before. 
**Outlet** is a connection created between interface and an object in the storyboard which is established when file is loaded. As the name implies, it's an outlet to display a value referred in the code in the storyboard. 
**Action** It's a type of method that defines what should be done if a particular event/action occurs. It defines the evemt type, sender of the event and receiver.
